## 2. Application Launch Flow
Upon launching Stockly, the user is greeted with a clean and visually appealing splash screen showcasing the Stockly logo. This helps reinforce brand recognition and sets a professional tone.

Immediately after the splash screen, the user is taken to the login page. The login interface is minimalistic and functional, requiring users to input their username and password. Two buttons are available:
- **Login**: Authenticates the user credentials.
- **Create Account**: Redirects new users to account registration.

In the event of incorrect credentials, a system-generated alert appears, explaining the failure reasonâ€”such as incorrect username or passwordâ€”along with an option to re-enter the data.
